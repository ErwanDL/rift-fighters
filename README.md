# League Fighters

League Fighters is a versus-fighting, fan-made game based on the League of Legends universe and characters. It uses Unity3d as the game engine.

This project is fan-made and is **not intended for commercial use**.

The project is being developed under the 2019.2 version of the Unity Editor.

## Project structure

-   The C# scripts for this project are located in _Assets/Scripts/_.

-   The models for the characters are located in _Assets/Models/_. They were extracted from the game files using _lol2dae_ and [Obsidian](https://github.com/Crauzer/Obsidian). [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) was used to re-rig and animate the characters.
-   The materials and sprites are respectively located in _Assets/Materials/_ and _Assets/Sprites_.

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the **GNU GPL Public License v3**. You cannot reuse this project for closed-source commercial projects.

## Interference with Project L

Riot Games recently announced that they were working on a 2.5D fighting game called "Project L", that will basically cover the same ground as this project. This means that this project will certainly evolve in a different direction in the future (partly to avoid any possible legal conflicts with Riot Games).
